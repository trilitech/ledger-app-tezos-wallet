name: Build apps

# This workflow will build the app and then run functional tests using the Ragger framework upon Speculos emulation.
# It calls a reusable workflow developed by Ledger's internal developer team to build the application and upload the
# resulting binaries.
# It then calls another reusable workflow to run the Ragger tests on the compiled application binary.
#
# While this workflow is optional, having functional testing on your application is mandatory and this workflow and
# tooling environment is meant to be easy to use and adapt after forking your application
