/*
 * All of the handlers must be defined together below.  We
 * define them together as they are required to present the
 * same interface and it's easier to validate if they are
 * in the same place.
 *
 * Handlers do not return a value, rather they set global.step
 * to ST_ERROR on errors.  We do this because we need a unified
 * error handling regime which also works with callbacks from
 * the UI code which has no way to percolate return values.
 *
 * Handlers frequently need to update the global state.  They
 * should do this by directly setting global.step.  Each handler
 * should:
 *
 *     1. if global.step == ST_IDLE, this is first time that the
 *        handler is being called and so all handler specific memory
 *        should be initialised,
 *
 *     2. the handler should assert that it is in the correct state.
 *
 * Note that (1) occurs before (2).  This is because if we are back in
 * ST_IDLE, that means that a previous invocation of this handler or a
 * callback in the UI bits has invalidated any existing transaction that
 * is in flight.  Our variables might be a union with other handlers and
 * all zeroes may not be the default state for any handler and so there
 * is no reliable way for any handler to reset its memory to a factory
 * default setting for another unspecified future handler.  And so, we
 * have each handler reset its data structures up front where we know
 * what the next handler is going to be.
