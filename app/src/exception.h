/*
 * In the handlers and the routines that they call, we define a set of
 * macros to standardise them, ease writing, and reduce repetition.
 *
 * Each function returns void.  We do this because we have to have the
 * same logic in callbacks from the UI code which may also send responses.
 * And so, to keep things the same we assume that all of our handlers
 * can't return values, either, and do things the same way in both places.
 * Our mechanism is to set global.step == ST_ERROR after we get an error.
 *
 * Each function should begin with TZ_PREAMBLE() which takes a
 * bracketted list of PRINTF() arguments.  It also sets up all of
 * the variables necessary for the following macros.
 *
 * Each function should end with TZ_POSTAMBLE which: sets up all of
 * labels to which the remaining macros jump; responds on error via
 * io_send_sw(); and sets global.step on error.
 *
 * TZ_CHECK() calls a function.  If global.step == ST_ERROR, it will
 * jump to the end after calling the function and let TZ_POSTAMBLE do
 * its thing.
 *
 * TZ_FAIL(sw_code) will set vars and jump into the postamble which
 * will reply using io_send_sw(sw_code) and set global.step = ST_ERROR.
 *
 * TZ_ASSERT(sw_code, condition) will TZ_FAIL(sw_code) if the condition
 * is not true.
 *
 * CX_CHECK() is a macro provided by BOLOS, however, we catch it
 * with this framework, reply with io_send_sw() and return TZ_DONE.
