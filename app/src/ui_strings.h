/* This implements a multi-page screen, allowing to display a
   potentially infinite number of screens, keeping a bounded history.
   The user can query new screens using the right button, and go back
   a few screens using the left button (until history limit is
   reached).

   When a new page is needed, the display will call the `refill`
   callback, which in turn can call `tz_ui_stream_push` to add a new
   page. When the last page is reached, `tz_ui_stream_close` should be
   called, and the two final special pages to `accept` and `reject`
   the operation are pushed. The user can trigger the `accept` and
   `reject` callbacks by pressing both buttons while there pages are
   displayed.

   It is also possible to use this display engine for non streamed
   data by pushing a precomputed series of pages with
   `tz_ui_stream_push`, calling `tz_ui_stream_close`, and launching
   with a `refill` callback set to NULL. */
